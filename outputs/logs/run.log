-   There is no indication of positive or negative emotions, such as joy, sadness, anger, or fear. The language is **factual and objective**.
-   The statement focuses on responsibility and consideration, which does not align with categories like surprise, love, annoyance, or confusion. The tone is **calm and reasoned**.)

2025-07-30 11:11:38,789 -  FutureAGI Tone Analysis: ['neutral'] (Reason: The text presents a balanced and objective perspective on AI development and deployment. 

-   It focuses on the necessity of diverse teams, thorough testing, continuous monitoring, and the importance of regulation and industry standards. The language used is factual and devoid of strong emotional indicators.
-   There is no indication of positive emotions like *joy* or *love*, nor negative emotions such as *fear*, *sadness*, *anger*, or *annoyance*. The text aims to inform rather than evoke an emotional response.
-   The absence of subjective opinions or emotional language makes other options unsuitable.)
